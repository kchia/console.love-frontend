# Project #3: console.love: A Dating and Friendship App for Programmers Version 1.0

## Overview

<img width="150" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55994508/74997584-07820380-541c-11ea-9355-b1c8bad08032.png" /> is an app for lonely software developers looking to connect with each other IRL. Users can create a profile for themselves and have it displayed on the home page for other users to see and match with. Users can also edit their own profiles to update their status.

**Concept** Idea (_source: Here_)

--RIXIO, this app was your idea so if you want to put a few words about what inspired you feel free

## Instructions
--RIXIO

On the home page, the user may either create a profile or continue as a guest. They will then be taken to the profiles page, which displays developers' pictures

## Hardware Platform

This is a responsive web-based application suitable for use on any device.

## The Making of the Application

--JAIMIE

For our wireframes and other planning info, see our [planning repo](Link to planning repo)

The console.love team used a combination of Centralized and Feature Branch Git Workflows, with an emphasis on pair programming. Responsibilities were distributed roughly as follows:

Jaimie - Project Manager/Scrum Master - Backend + Testing - Deployment - React Router
<br>
Muezzin - Git Manager - Javascript Guru - Algorithm Wizard
<br>
Rixio - Ideas Guy - CSS Master - Comfortable in React

These responsibilities were chosen based on team members' natural strengths. Each member worked on all aspects of the project, making sure to each learn something new. All planning and task tracking was handled through our Trello Team Board.  The team has set a rough schedule and will meet over Zoom. 
From the planning, to the building and the navigating through the construction and design.

## The API - JAIMIE WILL MOVE THIS SECTION TO THE BACKEND

Our JSON data was generated using [Mockaroo] and build under MongoDB to finally be pushed to Heroku.
